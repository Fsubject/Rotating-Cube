## How to install
1. Clone the github repo
2. Install the following modules: *pygame*, *numpy*
3. Run the *main.py* file

## Recommended models
Don't take too big models obviously it's a very small engine.
The most I used was a 913 vertices model with 950 faces, and it was running at 60fps.

## Contribute
I am *open* to contributions as long as you don't just break everything.
