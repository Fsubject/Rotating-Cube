- TODO Rotating-Cube:
1. Save each object's actual settings (scale, rotation_speed, position, etc.) after changing to another object
   so when I go back to the object, it will be the same as I left it.

2. Be able to scale down more for the bigger models (like the truck.obj) // update: I added a temporary fix that probably only works for the truck

3. render the model colors using .obj's vt lines
   how to: witch each .obj file comes a .mtl file, the .mtl file contains a line that starts with
           "newmtl NAME" -> this line basically create a new material that the .obj file will be able to use
                          the material define the color and other properties of the object.

           now in the .obj file, there are lines that start with "usemtl NAME" -> this line tells the .obj file
           which material he has to use for the following faces.

           -> SEE shotgun.obj & shotgun.mtl for example
           objective: render the shotgun model with the correct colors

4. more...
